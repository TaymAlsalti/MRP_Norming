<p>Besides the obvious age disparities due to the cohort design adopted
to collect the data for the TwinLife sample, we also see that our sample
is “overeducated” in the sense that for example we have too many kids
who were going to the Gymnasium (ST4: upper secondary) and too few
adults who have something similar to an Ausbildungsabschluss (ISCED 3b:
upper secondary, vocational). Migrants and females are also
overrepresented in the sample.</p>

has 5184 rows (number of subgroups/combinations of the 4 variables we
use). Most of these subgroups are empty in the sample.</p>

<p>Here we compare the RPP-based norms to the traditionally constructed
norms reported in the CFT 20-R manual. We aggregate by the age groups as
reported in the manual normal tables. Note that the manual means and SDs
for ages 20 and older are based on the very same TwinLife sample we are
using, they just use a different correction method that isn’t described
in enough detail to make it reproducible for us.</p>
