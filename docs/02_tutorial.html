<p>Before applying MRP to correct estimates (be it for norming or other
purposes), it’s worthwhile to check if there are any differences between
the sample and the population (on which we have data from the census)
with respect to the variables we wish to use for the correction. Here we
first look at disparities at the level of marginal distributions (e.g.,
is the overall proportion of males to females similar in our sample to
the population?), then at the joint distribution level (e.g., are female
citizens with no migration background, aged 67, who have a general
secondary school certificate as well represented in our sample as in the
population?).</p>

Besides the obvious age disparities due to the cohort design adopted to
collect the data for the TwinLife sample, we also see that our sample is
“overeducated” in the sense that for example we have too many kids who
were going to the Gymnasium (at school: upper secondary) and too few
adults who have something similar to an Ausbildungsabschluss (“isced 3b:
upper secondary, vocational”). Migrants and female are also
overrepresented in the sample.</p>

has 6528 rows (number of subgroups/combinations of the 4 variables we

<p>Despite the boosted <code>adapt_delta</code>, we still had 2
divergent transitions. However, we reran this model multiple times with
different <code>adapt_delta</code> and sometimes had up to 100 divergent
transitions without affecting the fit of the model. We can conclude that
the 4 chains converged since the <code>Rhat</code>s are consistently
<span class="math inline">\(&lt;1.01\)</span>. We see that the sd
<code>Estimate</code>s of the random intercepts for <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> are pretty small so we don’t
expect large variations in the residual variance depending on the
predictors. Larger sds can be observed for predicting <code>\mu</code>
(i.e., the actual CFT 20-R Scores). Males scored on average 0.96 on CFT
20-R than females. Spline related estimates are much harder to interpret
so instead we’ll at some plots.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Estimate CFT 20-R for

<p>Now that we have a post-stratified sample, we can use
<em>tidybayes</em>’s <code>add_predicted_draws()</code> function to draw
1000 samples (i.e., CFT 20-R Scores) from the posterior for each one of
the 10000 simulated participants in <code>sim_pop_sample</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sim_pop_sample_with_draws &lt;- sim_pop_sample %&gt;%

<p>This yields a dataframe in long format with 100000 (number of
simulated participants) * 1000 (number of draws from the posterior) =
100 million rows. <code>allow_new_levels = TRUE</code> is necessary for
estimating the outcome for combinations of the 4 predictors which do not
occur in the actual TL sample. This is inevitable in detailed enough
poststratification tables and was the case here as the
poststratification table we used had 6528 subcategories/rows. It wasn’t
the product of the number of categories of the four predictors <span
class="math inline">\(69*2*15*6\)</span> because a lot of combinations
of the variables were impossible, e.g., a PhD at the age of 11. The
<code>mutate()</code> call serves to set all predicted CFT 20-R 20-R
score scores which go below or above the scale limits (0 and 56,
respectively), to those scale limits.</p>

<p>This code chunk first aggregates by age and posterior draw (1000) to
compute the mean and SD of CFT 20-R estimates across the 100000
simulated participants. Then it computes the means and SDs across the
draws (which form the MRP means and SDs for each age group) and the SDs
of the means and SDs calculated in the previous step, hence yielding the
Bayesian SEs of the MRP means and SDs, respectively. Et voilà, an MRP
corrected norm table! Here the 14 first rows are shown.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> MRP norms vs. manual
norms vs. raw means</h2>
<p>Here we compare the MRP-based norms to the traditionally constructed
norms reported in the CFT 20-R manual. We aggregate by the age groups as
reported in the manual normal tables. Note that the manual means and SDs
for ages 20 and older are based on the very same TwinLife sample we are
using, they just use a different correction method that isn’t described
in enough detail to make it reproducible for us.</p>
