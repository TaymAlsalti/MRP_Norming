## Reproducibility

4 things are required to be able to rerun our code:

1. TwinLife data: versions 2 and 6 of the dataset have to be requested from [GESIS](https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA6701). Alternatively you can run the tutorial code on the synthetic sample we provide on our [OSF project](https://osf.io/2r9sy/).
2. [CFT 20-R, German version norms](https://www.testzentrale.de/shop/grundintelligenztest-skala-2-revision-cft-20-r-mit-wortschatztest-ws-und-zahlenfolgentest-zf-revision-ws-zf-r-90116.html): Means and SDs (Streuung) of "Teil-1 Max" have to be manually extracted from the manual for age groups 11;1-11;6 through 60-64. The Normalised Manual IQ values presented in Table 2 in the manuscript also have to be extracted.
3. The census tables, which we provide on our [OSF project](https://osf.io/2r9sy/).
4. To ensure the code works as expected, it's best to have the same versions of R and the packages we use. This can be arranged by using the renv.lock file found in the main RProject folder to download the exact versions of the packages we used. Note that before this can bedone, extra effort is needed to get _brms_ to work on your machine. That is, you might have to install the specific versions of _StanHeaders_ and _rstan_ (i.e., 2.26.28 and 2.32.3, respectively) we used directly from source before you can run `renv::restore()`. The package `remote` can be used for this. Here is a [walk-through](https://learnb4ss.github.io/learnB4SS/articles/install-brms.html) for installing `brms` on different operating systems.

Note that all code in our tutorial document can be executed based on materials we provide on our OSF repository.
