# Abstract
Good test norms are indispensable for accurate assessment of personality and ability and for calculating standardised effect sizes that can be compared across studies. They also make it easier to judge the representativeness of a sample by comparing the sample averages and standard deviations to their normed counterparts. Traditionally, norms are constructed from random, representative samples from the population. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to reach representative samples, as nonresponse soars and traditional methods like random digit dialling fail.  In psychology, representativeness of samples used for norms is rarely systematically evaluated and unlike in election forecasts, there is no regular, inherent check on the produced values. Moreover, for many widely used measures, large random samples are prohibitively expensive, when at all feasible.  Using cheap convenience samples, multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) uses information about the distribution of key demographic variables in the population in order to produce scores which better approximate the true population values. Here we apply MRP to data from the TwinLife study (N = 12953) to produce normed intelligence values for the CFT 20-R (Culture Fair Test). We find we can closely reproduce the traditionally produced norms. We also show how MRP can be used to derive personality norms from a large convenience sample.
