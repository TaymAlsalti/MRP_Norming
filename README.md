# Abstract
By itself, a raw score on a psychological test or measure has little meaning. Usually, individual scores can only be interpreted meaningfully when they are compared against a given reference population - a norm. Good test norms are important for accurate individual diagnostics, identifying sampling bias, and calculating standardised effect sizes that can be compared across studies. Traditionally, norms are constructed from random, representative samples from the population. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to reach representative samples as nonresponse soars and traditional sampling methods like random digit dialling fail. Outside of psychology, Multilevel Regression and Poststratification (MRP) is one of the most widely used methods to correct for nonrepresentative sampling. We argue that many areas of psychology research would greatly benefit from adopting MRP, and therefore provide this tutorial. MRP involves fitting a mixed-effects model to a large and diverse sample and weighting predicted scores by true population values (sourced from census data, for example). Using IQ test data from the TwinLife study (N = 10,059, Culture Fair Test, CFT 20-R) as an example, we show that MRP has the potential to make good test norms more accessible to psychologists by substantially reducing costs of sampling across a wide range of domains.
